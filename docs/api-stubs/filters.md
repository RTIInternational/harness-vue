# Charts

The following API functions allow developers to interact with filters. These functions are all mapped to the pinia store created for a given page, so they are available in a number of ways.

When using the global mixin for the options API, these will all be mapped to each component and available as `this.<function>`. In the `loadData` context, these will be available on the `pageStore` provided by the function.
