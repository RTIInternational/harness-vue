features:
  - title: Define pages once
    details: Harness-Vue page definitions abstract logic about charts and filters to avoid repetition and tedious state management boilerplate.
  - title: Interact with charts and filters with a simple API
    details: Manipulate filters, options, charts and caches with a robust but minimal API. Contextualized getters and setters allow for enhanced reusability in components.
  - title: Load data with the Harness-Vue lifecycle
    details: Apply filters, call APIs, manipulate data and ready it for display - all without having to manage reactivity.

  - title: Tech you trust
    details: Harness-Vue, built on top of Pinia, is well tested and well supported, powering many RTI projects.
